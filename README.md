# Titanic Survival Prediction using Boosting Algorithms

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting passenger survival on the **Titanic dataset** using advanced **Boosting Machine Learning algorithms**.  
The goal is to compare the performance of multiple boosting techniques and understand how ensemble learning improves prediction accuracy.

---

## Algorithms Used
The following boosting algorithms are implemented and compared:

- **AdaBoost**
- **XGBoost**
- **CatBoost**

Each model is trained, evaluated, and compared based on classification performance.

---

## Dataset
- **Dataset**: Titanic Survival Dataset  
- **Target Variable**: `Survived`
  - `1` → Survived
  - `0` → Did Not Survive
- **Features include**:
  - Passenger Class (`Pclass`)
  - Age
  - Sex
  - Fare
  - Embarked
  - Family-related features (SibSp, Parch)

---

## Workflow
1. Data Loading & Exploration (EDA)
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training using Boosting Algorithms
5. Model Evaluation & Comparison
6. Performance Analysis

---

## Results
- **Best Model**: CatBoostClassifier  
- **Best Accuracy Achieved**: ~86.5%
- Boosting algorithms showed significant improvement over basic models.

Evaluation metrics used:
- Accuracy Score
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Classification Report

---

## Visualizations
The project includes:
- Passenger distribution by class
- Survival analysis
- Feature impact visualizations

(All plots are generated using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.)

---

## Important Note (GitHub Compatibility)
To ensure smooth rendering on GitHub:
- Verbose training logs and heavy outputs were removed from the notebook.
- The core code, logic, and model implementation remain unchanged.
- The notebook can be fully re-run locally to reproduce all results.

> This is a common best practice for sharing ML projects on GitHub.

## Technologies & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- CatBoost
- XGBoost

---

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter
4. Run all cells to reproduce results

---

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Understanding boosting algorithms in depth
- Practical comparison of ensemble models
- Handling real-world ML project presentation for GitHub
- Model evaluation and interpretation
